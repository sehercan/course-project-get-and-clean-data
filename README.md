This repo consists of 3 files: run_analysis.R, Code book and README.MD

**1. run_analysis.R**

The code does  the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

* From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data can be found on <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

**2. Code Book**

The code book describes the variables, the data, and my work that I have performed to clean up the data.

**3. README.MD**

README is this file, which describes this repo.
